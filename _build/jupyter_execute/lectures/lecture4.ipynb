    "Loading this data into a database table can bring in problems mentioned above, resulting in serious data integrity issues, and hence we should do data normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization is the process of minimizing redundancy from a table of relations. These redundancies in relation may cause insertion, deletion, and update anomalies. Normal forms are a certain set of defined rules to \"break a table smartly\" to create normalized tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storytime:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ted Codd introduced the concept of normalization and first normal form in his [paper](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~zives/03f/cis550/codd.pdf) in 1970, which provides theoretical foundation of designing a database. After a year, he defined 2nd and 3rd normal form in [this](https://forum.thethirdmanifesto.com/wp-content/uploads/asgarosforum/987737/00-efc-further-normalization.pdf) paper. Later in 1974, Codd and Raymond F. Boyce defined the Boyce–Codd normal form (BCNF). These 4 normal forms are considered the most common or important ones; Most database systems are designed to follow the 3rd normal form or BCNF. \n",
    "\n",
    "Later came some more restrictive normal forms (4NF,5NF,6NF), but these are mainly used for theoretical purposes and are less implemented in industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We explain the normal forms in an easier-to-understand fashion, and they can also be explained using theoretical formulas and derivations.\n",

    "Often we refer to ACID or ACID Compliant databases. With modern No-SQL databases, we also hear about BASE databases. However, ACID was one of the fundamental properties of most early databases and is the reason for their broad adoption. It is an acronym that means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***A***tomic\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit of operation within an ACID database is the transaction. A transaction may involve one command or multiple commands. When multiple commands modify data, if one of them fails, the transaction is not committed (i.e., none of the operations are performed).\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g., We have a database with one table (Values) and two columns (a and b). We have an operation where, on a particular row, a value is subtracted from a and added to b. This might be similar to a banking transaction, where I withdraw money from my account to pay for a new pair of slippers. The operation takes place in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove value from a\n",
    "- Place value in b\n",
    "\n",
    "Atomicity ensures that if a system failure occurs between steps one and two, or if either step one or step two is invalid for any other reason, the entire transaction will not be processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***C***onsistent\n",
    "\n",
    "All data within the database follow the defined rules for the database, the defined rules for anyone table, and the defined rules for any one field. All operations on the database will return the same value, given the same set of underlying data each time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "E.g., We have table marks that give the breakdown of marking schemes for various courses. It is divided into quiz, participation, midterm, and final columns. All fields must be integers, and because these values make up the course marking scheme, each row must sum to 100. We can add a constraint to the table that ensures this using the CHECK operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database that ensures consistency would reject any transaction where the final result results in a marking sum <> 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***I***solation\n",
    "\n",
    "Any transaction occurs in isolation. One transaction cannot affect another transaction. When a transaction acts on the data, the tables or rows on which it acts are effectively locked to other transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If two transactions modify the same table, the sequence of operations will ensure that the first transaction completes before the second transaction can change the data.\n",
    "\n",
    " E.g., In that same marks table as before, let's assume that a department has decided that all final exam scores will be reduced by 5% and that that value will be shifted to participation. At the same time, an individual instructor in the program has decided to increase the final weighting and reduce the midterm weighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "If these operations are not isolated, the program-level transaction may reduce the weighting of the final exam. The instructor-level transaction\n",

    "The results of any transaction that completes successfully are permanently stored within the database.\n",
