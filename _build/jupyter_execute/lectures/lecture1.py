# # Lecture 0: Course Introduction
# Gittu George, January 4 2022

# ## Learning objectives
# 
# - To think critically about databases as part of an analytics workflow
# - Learn how to design, use and understand the inner working of the SQL based databases
# - Taking you from level zero to intermediate with the NoSQL databases (document and graph-based databases)
# - To work with the data to find the tools best suited to answering the questions you pose
# - To be able to present analytic workflows and decisions clearly to stakeholders
