    "Consider your database what you built as an independent entity. Then, follow instructions to set up your database in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "OKAY.. so now you have your database ready! In our case, we set up our Postgres database in RDS. Since you are not using an already existing database, you created it, so it's empty now. So we need to load data into this database. After loading data to the database, we are all set with querying from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether it's for loading or querying the database, we need to connect to the database. You all are aware of 2 other ways that you can use to interact with the database outside of this jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- pgadmin\n",
    "- psql\n",
    "\n",
    "What information do you want to know if you're going to connect to the above? We need to know the information of the database that you wanted to connect to \n",
    "- Hostname\n",
    "- Port number\n",
    "- User name (need to make sure that this user have access to the database)\n",
    "- Password (Ofcourse !! you need to know the password for this user)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to know more details refer to the installation notes for pgadmin & psql\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's think about other sources you want to connect to the database. Here are a few that I thought of\n",
    "- From a programming language (java, R, python, etc..)\n",
    "- From your jupyter notebook\n",
    "- From tableau \n",
    "- From excel \n",
    "- From R Studio\n",
    "- OR from any other application that you are using, e.g., your banking website\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides knowing the hostname, port name, username, and password, we also need to install an Application programming interface (API) that helps the applications on the client-side communicate with the server-side (in our case database). Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) and Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) are 2 of such APIs that are provided by the database vendor (Postgres, Oracle, MySQL, etc..) to access their database.\n",
    "\n",
    "JDBC is language-specific, and its the standard interface between any java application and database. JDBC converts the java programmer's requests to the database to something that the database understands (you can think of it as a translator). Meanwhile, ODBC is not language-specific, so it can convert requests from any application/software/programming language to something the database understands. Here is a diagram that will help you understand how ODBC works.\n",
