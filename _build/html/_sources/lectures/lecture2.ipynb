    "\n",
    "Whenever you come across any big-data article, you will hear about V's. 3V ’s definition was introduced in 2001 by Gartner Inc. analyst Doug Laney. After this, it evolved a lot with many other V's. Here I will be going through 4 V more common V's discussed in today's industry. The Four V's are, broadly speaking, Velocity, Veracity, Volume, and Variety. These were introduced to help understand the challenges of Big Data in computing and analytics.  The concepts are broadly applicable across all disciplines—for example, check what my colleague wrote about [big data in Ecology](https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biy068).  Various datasets or problems are affected differently by each of the different axes, so understanding the different dimensions of big data is critical to finding the analytic solutions we intend to apply.\n",

    "When we think about \"Big Data, \" this is often the most familiar dimension.  We think of Big Data in terms of gigabytes, terabytes, or petabytes.  The volume presents a significant challenge for data storage, although modern technology has reduced this challenge to some degree.  It also produces a challenge for recall (simply finding information) and for data processing (transforming and analyzing data). Here are the pointers to look out for:\n",
