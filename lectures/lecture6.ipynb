    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do humans store and search data?\n",
    "Think about how we used to store data before the era of computers? We used to store the data in books. Let's take this children's encyclopedia as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='img/ency.png' width=90%>\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",
    "\n",
    "There are around 300 `pages` in this book, and if a kid wants to know about `China`, they will go from the first `page` until she gets to 48th `page`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how a kid would `search`, but if you want to read about china, you would go to the `index` of this book, look for `China`, and go to the 48th page straight away. If you want to read some history about indexes, check out [this](http://www.elephant.org.il/indexing/a-history-of-index-creation) article.\n",
    "\n",
    "OKAY, now you all know how humans search for data from a book; Postgres also store and search data similarly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does Postgres store data? \n",
    "Information within a database is also stored in pages. A database page is not structured like in a book, but it's structured like below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='img/page.png' width=90%>\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",
    "\n",
    "So these pages are of 8 kB blocks; there are some meta-data as headers (green) at the front of it and item ID (yellow) that points to the tuples(rows). This ends with a special section (blue) left empty in ordinary tables, but if we have some indexes set on the tables, it will have some information to facilitate the index access methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "So a table within a database will have a list of pages where the data is stored, and these individual pages store multiple tuples within that table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read more about it [here.](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-page-layout.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does Postgres search data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a complicated table.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='img/table.png' width=70%>\n",
    "\n",
    "For explanation, let's assume that the contents in this table are stored in 3 page files. Here we are interested in finding the rows with the unique name that starts with `y`. A database, just like a kid, needs to search through the 3 pages to find the rows that contain a name that begins with `y`. This is a sequential search, and this is how a database search by default. This process could be slow if we got millions of rows spread across multiple pages, as the computer needs to go through the entire pages to find the names that start with y. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, here in this example, let's assume that Yokamino is on page 2, the database will find this on page 2, but it will still go to page 3 in search of other occurrences of names that start with y. WHY? Because it doesn't know that there is only a single occurrence of a name that starts with y. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at how Postgres search for data using `EXPLAIN`. We will do this on table `fakedata.testindex`,"
